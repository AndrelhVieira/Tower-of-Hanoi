                Hanoi Tower is a "puzzle" that consists of a base containing three pins, one of which are
                some discs on top of each other, in increasing order of diameter, from top to bottom. O
                The problem consists in passing all the disks from one pin to any other, using one of the pins as
                auxiliary, so that a larger disk is never on top of a smaller one in any situation. The number
                clubbing can vary, the simplest one containing only three. <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Currently, the Tower of Hanoi has traditionally been regarded as a procedure for assessing
                working memory capacity, and mainly planning and troubleshooting. Below there is
                an example photo of the game and then the rules for playing.
